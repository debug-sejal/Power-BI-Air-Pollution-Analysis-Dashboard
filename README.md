## 1. Project Title
Air Quality Analysis Dashboard – Power BI

## 2. Introduction
Designed an Air Quality Dashboard in Power BI to analyze pollutant levels across Indian states and cities. The dashboard tracks real-time pollutant concentration, state-wise comparisons, and maximum polluted regions, helping stakeholders and policymakers understand environmental risks.

## 3. Key Skills 
* Power BI (Data Modeling, DAX, Slicers, Interactive Visuals)
* Power Query (Data Cleaning & Transformation)
* DAX for KPIs (AQI Levels, % Change, Threshold Breach Count)
* Geo Mapping (state-wise & city-level pollutant tracking)
* MIS Reporting & Dashboard Design.
* File Format: .pbix and .png

## 4. Data Source
* Open-source Air Quality Index (AQI) datasets from government portals (publicly available)

## 5. Highlights
* **Business Problem**: Rising urban air pollution required continuous monitoring and actionable insights.
* **Goal**: Identify pollution hotspots, track AQI trends, and measure compliance against safety standards.
  
## 6. Key Visuals
* **Map (Maximum Polluted State)**: Highlights the most polluted states in India on a geographic view.
* **Bar Chart (Average Pollutant Level)**: Shows PM10 and PM2.5 as the highest pollutants compared to CO, NO2, and SO2.
* **Line Chart (Pollution by States)**: Compares pollutant averages across Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, and UP.
* **Bar Chart (Maximum Polluted City)**: Identifies Dhule, Bihar Sharif, and Nanded as the top polluted cities.
* **Data Table (Detailed Air Quality Data)**: Provides city-wise pollutant breakdown with average, max, and min values.
  
## 7. Business Impact & Insights
* Identified most polluted cities/regions, enabling policy prioritization.
* Revealed seasonal patterns (e.g., higher AQI in winter due to smog), supporting preventive action plans.
* Measured compliance with WHO air quality standards, helping government bodies monitor effectiveness of clean-air initiatives.
* Highlighted pollutant-specific contributors (PM2.5 major in urban areas), guiding sector-specific interventions like traffic control or industrial regulation.
* Supported public health awareness campaigns with data-driven evidence.
